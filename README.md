# FE-Bootcamp-W2-Challenge

In this project, I am building a portfolio page to showcase the HTML and CSS skills learnt so far in the course. 

Currently there are not enough web applications for me to link to and therefore I have used placeholder images and names. These are to be changed later in the course.


The requirements for the portfolio page are as follow: 
* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
